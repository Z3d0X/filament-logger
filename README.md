Configurable activity logger for filament.
Powered by `spatie/laravel-activitylog`

## Features
You can choose what you want to log and how to log it.
- Log Filament Resource Events
- Log Login Event
- Log Notification Events
- Log Model Events
- Easily extendable to log custom events

Note: By default this package will log Filament Resource Events, Access(Login) Events, and Notification Events. If you want to log a model that is not a FilamentResource you will have to manually register in the config file.

## Installation

This package uses [spatie/laravel-activitylog](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog), instructions for its setup can be found [here](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog/v4/installation-and-setup)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require z3d0x/filament-logger
```
After that run the install command:

```bash
php artisan filament-logger:install
```
This will publish the config & migrations from `spatie/laravel-activitylog`

## Authorization
To enforce policies on `ActivityResource`, after generating a policy, you would need to register `Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity` to use that policy in the AuthServiceProvider.
```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Providers;
 
use App\Policies\ActivityPolicy;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\AuthServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity;
 
class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    protected $policies = [
        // Update `Activity::class` with the one defined in `config/activitylog.php`
        Activity::class => ActivityPolicy::class,
    ];
    //...
}
```
> If you are using [Shield](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/shield) just register the ActivityPolicy generated by it

## Activity Model resolution
The main `Activity` class being used by the Filament Resource instance will be resolved by Spatie's service provider, which loads the model defined by the configuration key found at `activitylog.activity_model` in `config/activitylog.php`.
